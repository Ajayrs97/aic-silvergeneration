### Active Ageing Centres/Active Ageing Care Hubs (AAC/AACHs)  

------------------------------------------------------------

An Active Ageing Centre (AAC) or an Active Ageing Care Hub (AACH) is a drop-in social recreational centre that extends support to seniors living nearby in the community. It is a go-to point for seniors to receive timely access to quality care, have the opportunity to build strong social connections, take part in recreational activities, and contribute to the community as they wish.

Compared with Active Ageing Centres, Active Ageing Care Hubs provide additional care services, such as day care and community rehabilitation, in separate facilities nearby.
